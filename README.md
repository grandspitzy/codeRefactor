This assignment was assigned to us to refractor the code. Many of the css classes repeated itself so I went in and changed the classes around and gave a universal name to them. In the html I made sure the link worked, and gave semantic HTML5 names to some of the <div> elements. Also to make the site more accesible I added alt attributes to the image tags! The site was refractored and ready to launch by the end.
